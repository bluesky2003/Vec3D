Vec3D: Exploring structured molecular landscape by an explainable multi-modal model on single-cell multi-omics data

Vec3D for MATLAB is a free, open-source code for a broadly applicable “AI-for-biology” method for multi-modal analysis of single-cell multi-omics data, and provides a new and unified mathematical and biological explanation scheme for cellular heterogeneity.

At present, the manuscript about Vec3D is under review, and the code package V0.1 is freely accessed, whose decompression password can be requested from authors.
